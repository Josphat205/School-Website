## **Configuration Options**

1. Firewall

   - Turn on Firewall?
     - This helps protect your Computer from being attacked over the internet.
   - Turn on logging?
     - If there IS an infection, logs are useful for determining the source.

2. General System Protection

   - Enable Gatekeeper?
     - Defend against malware by enforcing code signing and verifying downloaded applications before allowing them to run.
   - Prevent automatic software whitelisting?
     - Both built-in and downloaded software will require user approval for whitelisting.
   - Disable Captive Portal Assistant and force login through browser on untrusted networks?
     - Captive Portal Assistant could be triggered and direct you to a malicious site WITHOUT any user interaction.

3. User Safety

   - Display all file extensions?
     - This prevents malware from disguising itself as another file type.
   - Disable saving documents to the cloud by default?
     - This prevents sensitive documents from being unintentionally stored on the cloud.
   - Show hidden files in Finder?
     - This lets you see all files on the system without having to use the terminal.
   - Disable printer sharing?
     - Offers redundancy in case the Firewall was not configured.
